# CSV examples

These are a few examples of how to use the csv library to read and write csv files.

- `plot_countries_with_reader.py` and `plot_countries_with_dictreader.py`  are examples of how to use the library to solve the Country Plotter problem.

- `writer_example.py` and `dictwriter_example.py` are examples of how to use the library to write csv files. Run each program, and then check out data.csv to see the results (you might want to delete it between runs).
